    <h3 class="title">Description:</h3>
    <p>Strawberry cake is a delightful dessert showcasing the taste of fresh strawberries.  The cake itself can be prepared in numerous ways, featuring strawberries throughout: incorporated into the batter, adorning the top of the cake, nestled between layers, or even within the frosting. Both fresh and frozen strawberries can be used, with fresh offering a brighter flavor and frozen providing a sweeter option. Bakers may also use strawberry-flavored gelatin to tint the batter a delicate pink.  Strawberry cake is typically served chilled, allowing the flavors to meld and creating a refreshing summer treat.</p>
